I have, in collaboration with my supervisor, Professor Jaco van de Pol, designed
\emph{I/O-efficient} algorithms and data structures to make Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) scale
beyond the limits of the machine's available memory.

\medskip

As part of this work, these algorithms have been implemented, evaluated, and improved upon to create
a new BDD library in C++, \emph{Adiar}. Compared to conventional implementations of BDDs, our work
is thoroughly tested, is almost as fast or even faster, and it has a more generic and user-friendly
API.
